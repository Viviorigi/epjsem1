        "question": "How often should I service my luxury watch?",
        "answer": "Most luxury mechanical watches should be serviced every 3-5 years to maintain optimal performance. Quartz watches typically require less frequent maintenance, but should still be checked every 5-7 years for water resistance and general condition."
      },

        "id": 2,
        "question": "What is water resistance in watches and what does it mean?",
        "answer": "Water resistance ratings indicate how well a watch is protected against water intrusion. For example, 30m rating is splash resistant (not for swimming), 100m is suitable for swimming and snorkeling, and 200m+ is appropriate for scuba diving. Always check your specific watch's guidelines."

      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "How do I know if my vintage watch is valuable?",
        "answer": "Several factors determine a vintage watch's value: brand reputation, model rarity, condition, originality of parts, historical significance, and documentation. For an accurate assessment, we recommend scheduling a professional appraisal with our experts."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "What's the difference between automatic and manual watches?",
        "answer": "Both automatic and manual watches use mechanical movements. The key difference is that automatic watches have a rotor that winds the mainspring using the motion of your wrist, while manual watches must be hand-wound regularly using the crown."

      },
      {
        "id": 6,
        "question": "How long does a typical watch repair take?",
        "answer": "Repair times vary depending on the complexity of the issue and parts availability. Simple repairs like battery replacements can be done while you wait. Basic services typically take 1-2 weeks, while complete overhauls or vintage restorations may take 4-8 weeks."

      {
        "id": 7,
        "question": "Do smart watches hold their value like luxury watches?",
